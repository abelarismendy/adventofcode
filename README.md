# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of Code is an annual event that consists of a series of small programming puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th.

## Directory Structure

Each year's solutions are organized in a separate folder with the following structure:

- `year/dayN.ext`: Solution to part 1 and 2 of day `day N` of year `year`.

Where `ext` is the file extension of the language used for the solution (e.g. `py` for Python).
